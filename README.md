# fg3d (Fratis Graphics 3D)
A 3D program that utilizes Unicons OpenGL capabilities
Written using the Unicon IDE.
This is a work in progress. 
fg3d is the slimmed-down version, and fg3dEDIT is the big experimental version. 
Both compile and run. I reccomend using the slimmed-down version as the big one has a lot of texture links, etc. that need to be reconfigured for your particular system.

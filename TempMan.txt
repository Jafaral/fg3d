These are usage instructions for the very Beta, in-progress version of fg3d.

If you do not have an executable version, continue reading. Otherwise skip to Section 2-.

Section 1-

To build from source:
https://github.com/shawnfratis/fg3d

To build you will need the Unicon compiler. More info here:
https://unicon.sourceforge.io/

pme.icn and poll.icn must be compiled as separate .exe's. 

voxw.icn, uw.icn, w.icn and s.icn must be compiled together. 

Everything, including .png's, must be in the same folder.

Section 2-

Unzip all contents to one folder.

Double-click fg3d.exe. 

Go to File/Load Model and then load warrior.x (presently, fg3d will not run without this file).

On the left hand side are numerical input boxes. On the bottom of the screen are function buttons. Labels marked "label" and "button" presently don't do anything.

Animation controls and message box also are not presently functional, but will be in the future.

Section 3-

To create a red cube,place your cursor in the "cube" entry box and enter 00100100111.
This will place a red cube in the scene.

The first three numbers are the X value (001).
The next three numbers are the Y value (001).
The next three numbers after that are the Z value (001).
The 10th number is the size of the cube (1).
The last number is the color, which in this case is red (1).

Numbers must be entered in order with no spaces, hashes or commas. X,Y and Z values are 3 digits each. Size and color are 1 digit each (1-9).

This number method is the same for sphere. Other functions vary slightly.

Section 4-

VOX R ARRAY
